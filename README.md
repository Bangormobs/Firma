# Firma
A Forge 1.11.2 Mod.

A from-basics mod which adds layers of low-tech gaming allowing for a richer game experience. Inspired by TerraFirmaCraft 1.

This is intended as an excersice to learn the ways that forge has changed since my previous mods based on 1.7.10. While the end-goal is to have a game I can enjoy the mod will not be a 1:1 replacement of Terrfirmacraft and will be significantly different in some areas.
